## Technologies Used

- Java SE
- Swing GUI toolkit
- Custom graphics handling for logo creation
- File I/O for image processing


## Configuration

- The application uses a custom logo. Ensure the logo file is placed in the correct directory and update the `LOGO_PATH` variable in `HomePage.java` if necessary.
- The system uses specific fonts (Segoe Script, Trajan Pro, Calibri). If these fonts are not available on your system, modify the font names in the code to use available alternatives.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement database integration for storing movie and customer data
- Develop an online booking interface for customers
- Add support for multiple cinema locations
- Integrate a payment gateway for online transactions
- Implement an admin panel for cinema staff to manage the system
